&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<h1>Shipping Process</h1>
<p class="light" >1. Processing:  When we receive your order, your order is processed to providers in 1 business day (excluding holidays and weekends).
 All orders are processed during normal business hours Monday through Friday.<br><br>
 2. Brand Fulfillment: After your order is processed, our brands will send your items to our warehouse. 
 This stage may take up to 15 business days (depending on the products) to process from our providers. More specific estimated processing time per 
 product is shown at cart and checkout pages. Please note that if your order includes bags, shoes or hand-made items, it may take longer to process. 
 \Occasionally there is unexpected delay or stock out items from our providers, in that case we may ship your order in separate packages.<br><br>
 3. Shipped: Once your order is ready to ship your will receive shipment confirmation email with tracking numbers 
 (multiple tracking numbers if your order is shipped with more than one package).
 Shipping time takes between 1-15 business days depending on the shipping method and your country of residence.</p><br><br>
 <h1>Shipping Policy</h1>
 <p>All orders are shipped from S. Korea or US via DHL, UPS, FedEx, USPS, K-Packet or EMS with tracking number.
 We choose the courier based on our criteria to provide the best service. Unfortunately, selecting the courier isnâ€™t currently available.<br><br>

Please keep in mind that your order may see some delay in the shipping process due to delay in receiving one or more items from our providers.
 In this case, we will be in contact to inform you, and ship them as soon as all your items are ready.<br><br>

In case the package is returned to our warehouse due to customer's failure to receive, refusal to receive, or pick up the package 
(DHL, UPS, FedEx or Post Office usually attempts to deliver the package up to 3 times and after that keeps the package in their facility between 10 days to 25 days), 
customers will be charged for penalty fee (original shipping fee + return shipping fee + tariff if applicable, exact amount determined after the receipt of the
 package in our warehouse) which is significantly higher than the shipping fee you originally paid. The penalty fee varies depending on the country and will be notified individually.
<br><br>
All products may be subject to tariff and customers are fully responsible of any custom duty upon receipt of the products.
